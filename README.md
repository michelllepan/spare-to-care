## Spare to Care

Spare to Care features an embedded button on purchase checkout pages, which gives a user the option to round up their order total from popular online retailers. Each time the user rounds up, the extra amount is added to an accumulated total which serves as a donation pledge. From our extension site, the user can then view information about a variety of organizations. There, users can read about the impact a donation can make and choose one to donate their pledge, which will open the organization’s donation page in a new tab with their pledge amount autofilled into the webpage.
